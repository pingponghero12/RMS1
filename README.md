My first try at making solid-propellant rocket motor simulator. Program is written in C, with both comments and documentation in polish. Only handles BATES geometry. 

Thanks to this project I managed to understand basics of rocket motor physics and how to go about writing simulators for such models. Big success of this project is in my opinion well writen documentation, which explains basic formulas used by simulator and it's algorithm.
